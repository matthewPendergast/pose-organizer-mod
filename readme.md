<h1>Pose Organizer</h1>

<p>This is an upcoming mod for Cyberpunk 2077 which will allow you to organize photo mode pose mods using an interface that lets you rename categories/poses, create new categories, and move poses from one category to another.</p>
<p>Because it has not yet been published to Nexus, this repo is intentionally missing key files necessary for it to function properly in-game. However, it should be finished and ready for release very soon.</p>
